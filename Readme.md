INFORMATION

The idea basically comes from the pandemic we are going through, 
and which has made it difficult for us to go back to our normal 
life. As we ourselves went through a lockdown, we know how much 
trauma it can cause and how much there is a need to look at oneâ€™s 
mental health. We thought this will contribute highly for the 
prevention of mental disorders, as psychiatrist can use this 
application to meet their patients and get to know how their 
patients are going through in tough times like these. Keeping 
in mind that psychiatrist cannot tell much by just looking at 
the person through video call, we used AWS recognition to tell 
psychiatrist the state of emotions their patients are going 
through, which is going to be very helpful for the doctor to 
know how the session could be conducted.
